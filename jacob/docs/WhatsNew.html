<h1>What's New in JACOB 1.9</H1>
<ul>

<li>
<b>Event Callbacks</b>
Variant parameters can now be modified by the receiver
</li>


<li>
<b>Dispatch API changes</B>
All static method's first parameters have been more strongly typed
to the Dispatch class, rather than Object.  This may call for code
changes in the cases of code that just asigned Dispatch objects 
to variables of type Object rather than Dispatch or one of its subclasses
</li>

<li>
<b>Dispatch subclasses are now supported with pointer modifying constructor</b>
Dispatch now includes a constructor to be used by Dispatch subclasses
that swaps the pointers around.  This eliminates the need for every Dispatch subclass
to have a constructor that swapped and nulled the pointers to the COM layer.
All samples have updated to use the new api
</li>

<li>
<b>ActiveXComponent can return ActiveXComponets</b>
Methods have been added to the ActiveXComponents to retrieve
parameters as Dispatch objects or ActiveX components.  The
Script Tests have been updated to show the same programs in Dispatch
format or ActiveXComponentFormat
</li>

<li>
<b>JNI Changes</b>
Object removal has been accellerated through the use of hash maps.
Array dimension checking fixed for certain boolean set and get functions
</li>



</ul>

<h1>What's New in JACOB 1.8</H1>
<ul>

<li>
<b>Move To SourceForge</b>
The project is not housed at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/">Sourceforge.net</a>.
</li>

<li>
<b>Licensing Change</b>
All limitations on commercial use of JACOB have been removed and it
is now being developed under a BSD license at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/">Sourceforge.net</a>.
</li>

<li>
<b>Compiled with Java 1.4.2</b>
Version 1.8 was compiled with JSEE 1.4.2 and fixes the compilation bug
that was remnant of compilation with JDK 1.1.
</li>

<li>
<b>Baseline For Change</b>
This version is the baseline for the first CVS checkin and we encourage
people to start contributing to the project with this version.
</li>

<h1>What's New in JACOB 1.7</H1>
<ul>

<li>
<b>Explicit COM Threading Model Support:</b>
See a detailed discussion of
<a href="JacobThreading.html">COM Apartments in JACOB</a>
</li>

<li>
<b>New COM Object Lifetime model:</b>
See a detailed discussion of
<a href="JacobComLifetime.html">COM Object Lifetime in JACOB</a>.
</li>

<li>
<b>Improved Event Handling:</b>
Thanks to code contributed by 
<a href="mailto:n.o.bouvin@daimi.au.dk">
Niels Olof Bouvin</a>
and <a href="mailto:jehoej@daimi.au.dk">Henning Jae</a> JACOB 1.7 can
read the type information of a Connection Point interface by looking
it up in the registry. This makes it possible to use events with IE as
well as office products.
</li>


<li>
<b>Improved Dispatch:</b>
Error messages from Invoke failures are now printed out as well as
allowing the passing in of arguments to a Get method.
</li>

<li>
<b>EnumVariant Implementation:</b>
Makes it easier to iterate over COM collections. Thanks to code
contributed by 
<a href="mailto:Thomas.Hallgren@eoncompany.com">Thomas Hallgren</a>.
</li>

<li>
<b>SafeArray leaks:</b>
SafeArrays were not being properly freed prior to version 1.7, many
other memory leaks were fixed as well.
</li>

<li>
<b>Visual Studio Project:</b>
For those who want to debug: vstudio/jacob. At the moment all the
native code is replicated there from the jni directory...

Steven Lewis is developing a version of Java2Com that supports JACOB
code generation. See:

To find documentation on the com.ms.com package, go to:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/download/dl_sdk40.htm">
http://www.microsoft.com/java/download/dl_sdk40.htm</a>
and at the bottom of the page is a link that says: 
Microsoft SDK for Java 4.0 Documentation Only. You should download
that file and install it. Then, view sdkdocs.chm and look for
"Microsoft Packages Reference". Hopefully, the next release of
JACOB will include full javadoc (volunteers?)...
