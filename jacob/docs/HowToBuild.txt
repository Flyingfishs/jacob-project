To build, run:
Unpack this archive into d:\jacob

The following assumptions are coded into the makefile in the 
root directory and may have to be changed for your environment
	JDK = d:\j2sdk1.4.2_06
	DEST_DIR = d:\jacob
	MSDEVDIR = d:\apps\\"Microsoft Visual Studio"\VC98

The makefiles will:
	Build the Java code
	Build the jni code
	create the dll
	create jar file
	<optionally> create the zip files
	
To build:
	Run VCVARS32 to set up your MS Visual C++ environment
	cd d:\jacob
	nmake

(from dan)I developed this with the C++ compiler and ATL version
that ship with VC++ 6.0, so I'm not sure if different versions will
work.

This is currently designed to compile against JDK 1.4.2.  The future
of the Microsoft SDK is in doubt so support may be discontinued
in the future.


The java code is in com\jacob\*.
The C++ code is in .\jni.


Release Notes:
1/2005 code should compile now without out any additional tools. 
References to cp and rm were removed from makefiles
